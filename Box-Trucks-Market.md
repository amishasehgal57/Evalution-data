Furthermore, the increasing adoption of combination therapies that include beta blockers is expected to play a vital role in driving market expansion as healthcare providers seek comprehensive treatment solutions for patients.</p> <p>By 2024, the beta blocker market is projected to generate revenue of approximately <strong>$6.5 billion</strong>, reflecting a strong upward trend.
