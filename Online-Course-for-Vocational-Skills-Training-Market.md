As industries evolve, the need for continuous learning and skill enhancement has become more essential. The convenience and accessibility of online courses have contributed to their popularity among professionals seeking career advancement. Furthermore, the shift towards remote learning, accelerated by the global pandemic, has opened new avenues for growth in this sector.</p>        <p>According to recent estimates, the market for online vocational skills training is projected to reach <strong>$25 billion</strong> by 2024, demonstrating a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of <strong>12%</strong> from 2024 to 2032.
