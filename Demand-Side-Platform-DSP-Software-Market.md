As marketers strive for more effective targeting and measurement capabilities, the reliance on automated solutions provided by DSP software becomes increasingly prevalent. The shift from traditional to digital advertising coupled with the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies within DSPs are expected to enhance efficiencies and drive further adoption.</p> <p>Favorable trends in mobile advertising and the growing significance of data analytics for targeting and retargeting campaigns are also contributing factors. Businesses are increasingly leveraging consumer data to create more personalized advertising experiences, which DSPs facilitate effectively.
